Service Booking Application – Project Description

Service Booking Application is a full-stack web application designed to simplify the process of discovering, booking, and managing services through a secure and user-friendly platform. The system allows users to create accounts, browse available services, book appointments, and track their booking history, while administrators can manage and update service listings.

The application implements secure authentication using encrypted passwords and token-based session handling to ensure data privacy and safe access. A structured backend architecture handles service management, booking logic, and user validation, while the responsive frontend provides an intuitive interface for seamless interaction across devices.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of RESTful APIs, database relationships, and role-based access control, reflecting real-world use cases such as appointment scheduling and service management systems.
